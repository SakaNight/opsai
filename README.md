## API Examples

### REST Endpoints
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Create an Incident
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/incidents \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"API latency spike","severity":"high","source":"pagerduty"}'

# Get all Incidents
curl http://localhost:3000/incidents

# Execute AI Agent Workflow
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/v1/workflow/execute \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"eventId":"incident_001","eventData":{"title":"Database timeout","severity":"high"}}'

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. MongoDB Connection: Ensure MongoDB container is running
2. Redpanda Issues: Check Redpanda logs for configuration errors
3. Port Conflicts: Verify no other services are using required ports
4. Service Dependencies: Start infrastructure before services

### Recently Resolved Issues
1. Document Processing Error: Fixed Qdrant ID type mismatch by changing ID from string to number
2. MongoDB Authentication Error: Fixed by recreating container and ensuring init script execution
3. Kafka ObjectId Type Error: Resolved by converting MongoDB ObjectId to string before sending to Kafka
4. Event Flow Interruption: Wikimedia events now process continuously without errors

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View service logs
docker compose logs [service-name]

# Restart specific service
docker compose restart [service-name]

# Check Ingestor service logs
cd apps/ingestor && npm run start:dev
```
